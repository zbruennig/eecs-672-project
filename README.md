# eecs-672-project

### What is this?

This is the code I have written for computer graphics. The majority of the coding in this class relates to one project which I extend through new features and more advanced and sophisticated techniques in lighting, modeling, and viewing.

One thing I really enjoy about this project is that we have free reign to go in whichever direction we choose to. All of the geometry, the setting, and most of the details are left up to me.

The language for this project is c++, though a fair amount of code will be in a shader and graphics language known as OpenGL. Additionally my c++ code will make heavy use of its API.

For more information on OpenGL, check out their [website](https://www.opengl.org/).

### Project 2

Project 1 is unrelated and served as an introduction to the framework. This project is the first of three of creating and extending a scene.

For this project, I have constructed a pool table, with a simple lighting model and relatively basic geometry. This code runs fine on Linux operating systems, however my attempts to make it run on OSX have been unsuccessful, due to differences in supported versions and Makefiles.
